# Pipeline Preparation
The PhytoOracle (PO) pipelines require the aforementioned GCP and GeoJSON files. Additionally, a Yet Another Markup Language (YAML) file is used by PO for automated, reproducible data processing. YAMLs are a form of a configuration file that can be used to define a series of arguments/flags. The details of the YAML files can be found on our PhytoOracle Automation repo: [click here](https://github.com/phytooracle/automation/blob/main/docs/yaml.md).

## Editing YAML file {#yaml}
For each season, YAML files must be edited to correctly process data for the respective season. 

Specifically, the following keys should be edited for each season:

- tags
  - pipeline
  - season
  - season_name
- workload_manager
  - manager_name
- paths
  - cyverse
    - input
      - necessary_files
      
Examples of YAMLs for each season can be found [here](https://github.com/phytooracle/automation/tree/main/yaml_files).

## Updating GitHub Repositories

### PhytoOracle Data
At the start of a new season, the phytooracle_automation repo. Specifically, the season_config_yaml variable needs to be updated: [click here](https://github.com/phytooracle/phytooracle_data/blob/3e780d8b5c5c5a8515f6dfcd0ec60347d57d8319/phytooracle_data/seasons.py#L11). 

The season is defined by multiple keys, including name, start_date, end_date, flir_temp_units, and complete_field_dates (**Figure \@ref(fig:phytooracledataplot)**).

Below are some details for each key:

- name: Season name, as it shows up on the CyVerse DataStore
- start_date: Date of planting
- end_date: Date of harvest
- flir_temp_units: Temperature units reported by thermal (FLIR) images
- complete_field_dates: List of RGB scan dates

```{r phytooracledataplot, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%", fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Section of the $season_config_yaml$ variable in the $phytooracle_data$ GitHub repository."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("./images/Screenshot 2023-12-19 202056.png"))
```

To get a list of RGB dates, use iRODS to ils the directory of the respective season (**Figure \@ref(fig:ilsplot)**).

```{r ilsplot, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Getting RGB dates using iRODS."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("./images/Screenshot 2023-12-19 202934.png"))
```

### PhytoOracle Landmark Selection
The PhytoOracle [3d_landmark_selection](https://github.com/phytooracle/3d_landmark_selection) contains the phytooracle_data repository. As such, the 3d_landmark_selection container must be rebuilt once the abovementioned changes have been made to phytooracle_data repository. To do so, access the container [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/phytooracle/3d_landmark_selection/builds) and click on "Trigger" for the "latest" container (**Figure \@ref(fig:containerplot)**).

```{r containerplot, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", out.height="100%", fig.show='hold', fig.align='center', fig.cap="Rebuilding the $3d_landmark_selection$ container on DockerHub."}
knitr::include_graphics(c("./images/Screenshot 2023-12-19 205331.png"))
```
